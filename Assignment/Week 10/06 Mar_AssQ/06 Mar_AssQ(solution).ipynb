    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It provides methods for making inferences about the characteristics of a population based on a limited set of observations or data points. The goal of statistics is to gain insights, detect patterns, and draw conclusions from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptive Statistics:** These methods involve summarizing and organizing data to describe its main features. Measures such as mean (average), median (middle value), mode (most frequent value), range, and standard deviation fall under descriptive statistics. These measures help in providing a concise summary of the main aspects of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics:** Inferential statistics involve making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data. This includes hypothesis testing, estimation, and regression analysis. The goal is to draw conclusions that extend beyond the immediate data at hand."

    "\n",
    "   - **Example:** Imagine you have collected the scores of students in a class on a recent math test. Using descriptive statistics, you can calculate the mean (average) score to get a sense of the typical performance. Additionally, you might compute the standard deviation to understand how much the scores vary from the average, providing a measure of the test's overall difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Inferential statistics involves making inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Example:** Suppose you want to know if a new teaching method improves students' math performance. You could select a sample of students, apply the new method to them, and then use inferential statistics to determine if the observed improvement is likely due to the new method or if it could have occurred by chance. This might involve hypothesis testing to compare the means of two groups."

    "1. **Mean (Average):**\n",
    "   - **Calculation:** The mean is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of observations.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It represents the central or typical value of a dataset. The mean is sensitive to extreme values and is appropriate for interval and ratio data.\n",

    "2. **Median:**\n",
    "   - **Calculation:** The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Variance:**\n",
    "   - **Calculation:** Variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It measures the overall variability in a dataset. However, it is in squared units, so the standard deviation is often preferred for a more interpretable measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "   - **Calculation:** Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "   - **Use:** Like variance, it measures the spread of data points. It is in the same units as the original data, making it more interpretable than variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interquartile Range (IQR):**\n",
    "   - **Calculation:** IQR is the range of the middle 50% of the values in a dataset, representing the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1).\n",
    "   - **Use:** IQR is less sensitive to extreme values than the range and provides a robust measure of variability, especially in the presence of outliers."
