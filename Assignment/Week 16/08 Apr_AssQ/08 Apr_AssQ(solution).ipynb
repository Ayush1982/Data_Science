    "When developing an SVM regression model to predict house prices based on several characteristics, the choice of regression metric depends on the specific requirements and priorities of the problem. However, some commonly used regression metrics in this situation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**\n",
    "   - MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices.\n",
    "   - It provides a straightforward interpretation of the average prediction error in the same units as the target variable (e.g., dollars).\n",
    "   - MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to other metrics like MSE, making it suitable when the dataset contains outliers that might significantly affect the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**\n",
    "   - MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices.\n",
    "   - It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors due to the squaring operation.\n",
    "   - MSE is commonly used and provides a good indication of the overall model performance.\n",
    "   - However, it can be sensitive to outliers, which might inflate the error metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**\n",
    "   - RMSE is the square root of the MSE and provides a measure of the average magnitude of the errors in the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "   - RMSE is interpretable and easier to compare across different models.\n",
    "   - Like MSE, RMSE is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Coefficient of Determination (R-squared):**\n",
    "   - R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
    "   - It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.\n",
    "   - R-squared provides a measure of how well the regression model captures the variation in the target variable.\n",
    "   - However, it does not provide information about the prediction error and should be used in conjunction with other metrics."

    "The more appropriate evaluation metric would be Mean Squared Error (MSE) rather than R-squared. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MSE (Mean Squared Error):**\n",
    "   - MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices.\n",
    "   - It penalizes larger errors more heavily due to the squaring operation.\n",
    "   - MSE provides a direct measure of the average magnitude of the errors, making it suitable for assessing the accuracy of predictions in terms of absolute error.\n",
    "   - In the context of house price prediction, minimizing MSE implies minimizing the average squared difference between predicted and actual prices, which aligns with the goal of predicting prices as accurately as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination):**\n",
    "   - R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable (house prices) that is predictable from the independent variables (features).\n",
    "   - While R-squared provides a measure of how well the regression model captures the variation in the target variable, it does not directly reflect the accuracy of individual predictions.\n",
    "   - R-squared is more focused on explaining the variability in the target variable rather than minimizing prediction errors.\n",
    "   - A high R-squared value does not necessarily mean that the predictions are accurate in terms of absolute error, especially if the model is overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE is more appropriate when the goal is to predict house prices as accurately as possible because it directly measures the average prediction error, penalizes larger errors, and provides insight into the magnitude of prediction errors. R-squared, while useful for understanding the overall goodness-of-fit of the model, may not directly reflect the accuracy of individual price predictions. Therefore, MSE would be the preferred evaluation metric in this scenario."

    "Dataset that contains a significant number of outliers, robust regression metrics are preferred as they are less sensitive to the impact of outliers. One such metric that is particularly suitable for this scenario is the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Robustness to Outliers**:\n",
    "   - MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "   - Unlike the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which squares the errors and thus gives higher weight to larger errors, MAE treats all errors equally regardless of their magnitude.\n",
    "   - As a result, MAE is less influenced by outliers compared to MSE, making it more robust in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretability**:\n",
    "   - MAE provides a straightforward interpretation as the average absolute prediction error.\n",
    "   - The absolute values make it easier to understand the typical deviation of predictions from the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ease of Optimization**:\n",
    "   - When optimizing models, minimizing MAE is straightforward as it does not involve squared terms or complicated calculations.\n",
    "   - Models trained with MAE as the loss function are more likely to converge reliably, even in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-world Relevance**:\n",
    "   - In many real-world scenarios, particularly in domains where outliers are common (such as finance or healthcare), minimizing the absolute prediction error is more meaningful and relevant than minimizing squared errors."

    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Units**: \n",
    "   - RMSE inherently accounts for the scale of the target variable. It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors due to the square root operation. This means that RMSE is more sensitive to large errors, which might be more relevant in certain applications.\n",

    "3. **Comparability**: \n",
