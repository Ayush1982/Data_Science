    "1. **Standardization:** The z-score standardizes data, allowing for meaningful comparisons across different datasets that may have different units or scales. By converting data into z-scores, we can determine how unusual or extreme an individual observation is compared to the rest of the dataset.\n",

Additionally, z-scores can be used to find percentiles in a normal distribution, helping to interpret the relative position of an observation within a dataset.\n",

    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a powerful theorem in statistics, but it comes with certain assumptions for its validity. These assumptions are crucial for the theorem to hold true. The main assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independence:** The samples used to calculate the sample mean must be independent of each other. This means that the outcome of one sample should not influence the outcome of another sample. Independence is essential to ensure that the sample means are not biased or dependent on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identically Distributed:** The samples must be drawn from a population with the same probability distribution. In other words, the data points within each sample must come from the same population and follow the same probability distribution. This assumption ensures that the samples are comparable and that the sample means are calculated consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Finite Variance:** The population from which the samples are drawn must have a finite variance. This assumption ensures that the variability within the population is bounded and does not become too extreme. Without a finite variance, the Central Limit Theorem may not hold, and the distribution of sample means may not approach a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Large Sample Size:** The Central Limit Theorem is most accurate and applicable when the sample size (\\( n \\)) is sufficiently large. Although there is no strict rule for what constitutes a \"large\" sample size, a common guideline is that the sample size should be greater than or equal to 30. Larger sample sizes tend to produce more accurate estimates of the population parameters and result in better approximations to the normal distribution."
