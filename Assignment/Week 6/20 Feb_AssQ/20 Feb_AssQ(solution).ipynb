    "\n",
    "    Data is sent in the URL as query parameters. The data is visible in the URL, making it suitable for transferring small amounts of non-sensitive data.\n",

    "2) POST Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    POST is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource on the server. It is primarily used for sending data that will be stored or modified on the server, such as form submissions, file uploads, or creating new records.\n",

    "    Data is sent in the request body rather than in the URL. This allows for larger amounts of data and more secure transmission, suitable for sensitive information.\n",

    "the redirect() function is used to perform a server-side HTTP redirection to a different URL. It allows you to send a response to the client that instructs the client's browser to navigate to a new URL. The primary reasons for using the redirect() function in Flask are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Changing URLs: You can use redirect() to change the URL displayed in the user's browser. This is useful when you want to direct users from one route to another, for example, after they have successfully completed a form submission or logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Navigation Flow: It helps in defining the flow of your web application. After performing certain actions or when certain conditions are met, you can use redirect() to guide users to specific pages or routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Route Centralization: In larger Flask applications with multiple routes, you can centralize common redirection logic in one place using redirect(), making the codebase more maintainable."
