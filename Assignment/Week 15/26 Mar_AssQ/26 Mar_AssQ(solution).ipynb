    "Linear regression relies on several assumptions for its validity. Violation of these assumptions can lead to biased estimates and inaccurate predictions. The key assumptions of linear regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable should be linear. This means the change in the target variable is proportional to the change in the predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence**: The residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) should be independent of each other. This assumption is crucial to ensure that there is no correlation between the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the predictor variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be uniform along the range of predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality of Residuals**: The residuals should follow a normal distribution. This means the errors should be symmetrically distributed around zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Residual Analysis**: Plotting the residuals against the predicted values or the predictor variables can help detect violations of linearity, independence, and homoscedasticity. Residual plots should exhibit a random scatter around zero with no clear patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normality Tests**: Statistical tests such as Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plot can be used to assess the normality of residuals. If the p-value of the normality test is below a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), it suggests deviation from normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity Tests**: Tests like Breusch-Pagan test or White test can be employed to formally assess homoscedasticity. These tests evaluate whether the variance of the residuals is constant across different levels of the predictor variables."
