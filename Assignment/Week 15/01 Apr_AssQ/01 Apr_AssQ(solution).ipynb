    "   - Linear regression is used when the dependent variable (the variable you are trying to predict) is continuous and the relationship between the independent variable(s) (the variables used to make predictions) and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear.\n",
    "   - The output of linear regression is a continuous value. It aims to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.\n",
    "   - Example: Predicting house prices based on factors like area, number of bedrooms, and location. Here, the dependent variable (house price) is continuous, and we are trying to predict a specific value.\n",

    "   - Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical (usually binary) and the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear on the logit scale.\n",
    "   - The output of logistic regression is the probability that a given observation belongs to a particular category or class.\n",

    "   - L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the logistic regression cost function that is proportional to the absolute values of the model coefficients.\n",

    "1. **Construction of the ROC Curve**:\n",
    "   - The ROC curve is created by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.\n",
    "   - TPR, also known as sensitivity or recall, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances in the dataset. It measures the proportion of actual positive instances that are correctly classified as positive by the model.\n",

    "   - The ROC curve provides a visual representation of the trade-off between the TPR and FPR as the discrimination threshold of the logistic regression model is varied.\n",
    "   - A diagonal line (the line of no-discrimination) is drawn from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner of the ROC plot, representing the performance of a random classifier.\n",
    "   - A good logistic regression model will have an ROC curve that is closer to the top-left corner of the plot, indicating higher TPR and lower FPR across different threshold settings.\n",
    "   - The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) is a scalar value that quantifies the overall performance of the logistic regression model. AUC-ROC ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating better discrimination performance. A model with an AUC-ROC of 0.5 performs no better than random guessing, while a model with an AUC-ROC of 1.0 indicates perfect discrimination.\n",

    "   - The ROC curve allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the logistic regression model's ability to classify instances into the positive and negative classes across different threshold settings.\n",

    "1. **Univariate Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - This technique involves selecting features based on univariate statistical tests such as chi-square test for categorical variables and ANOVA F-test for continuous variables.\n",
    "   - Features are evaluated individually against the target variable, and a significance threshold is used to select the most relevant features.\n",

    "- **Improved Interpretability**: Including only the most important features simplifies the model and makes it easier to interpret and understand.\n",
    "- **Reduced Computational Complexity**: Fewer features lead to faster model training and inference, especially in the case of large datasets with many features.\n",
