    "Ridge Regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization or L2 regularization, is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression objective function. This penalty term is proportional to the sum of squared coefficients (L2 norm) and is used to prevent overfitting and improve the stability of the regression estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective Function**:\n",
    "   - OLS Regression: In ordinary least squares regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals (errors) between the observed values and the predicted values. The regression coefficients are estimated by finding the values that minimize this sum of squared residuals.\n",
    "   - Ridge Regression: In Ridge Regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals, similar to OLS regression, but with the addition of a penalty term. This penalty term, controlled by a regularization parameter (lambda or alpha), is proportional to the sum of squared coefficients. The objective function in Ridge Regression is the sum of squared residuals plus the penalty term.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regularization**:\n",
    "   - OLS Regression: OLS regression does not include any regularization or penalty term. It estimates the regression coefficients solely based on minimizing the sum of squared residuals, which can lead to overfitting when the number of predictors is large relative to the number of observations.\n",
    "   - Ridge Regression: Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the objective function to penalize large coefficients. This penalty term, proportional to the sum of squared coefficients, encourages the model to shrink the coefficients towards zero, reducing their variance and improving their stability. Ridge regression effectively addresses multicollinearity and helps prevent overfitting by introducing bias to the estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bias-Variance Trade-off**:\n",
    "   - OLS Regression: OLS regression tends to have low bias but may have high variance, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or multicollinearity among predictors.\n",
    "   - Ridge Regression: Ridge regression introduces bias by shrinking the coefficients towards zero, but it often leads to a reduction in variance, particularly in situations where multicollinearity is present or when the number of predictors is large relative to the number of observations. This bias-variance trade-off helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalization performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regularization Parameter**:\n",
    "   - In Ridge Regression, the strength of the regularization penalty is controlled by a regularization parameter, often denoted as lambda or alpha.\n",
    "   - The choice of the regularization parameter determines the trade-off between fitting the training data well and keeping the model simple. Higher values of the regularization parameter result in more shrinkage of coefficients and a more parsimonious model."

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. **Linearity**: Ridge regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables (predictors) and the dependent variable (response) is linear. This means that the effect of a one-unit change in an independent variable is constant across all levels of that variable, holding other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence**: Ridge regression assumes that the observations (samples) used to estimate the regression coefficients are independent of each other. Independence ensures that the errors (residuals) associated with each observation are not correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: Ridge regression assumes that the variance of the errors (residuals) is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals around the regression line remains consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality of Errors**: Ridge regression assumes that the errors (residuals) follow a normal distribution with a mean of zero. This assumption ensures that the estimates of the regression coefficients are unbiased and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Perfect Multicollinearity**: Ridge regression assumes that there is no perfect multicollinearity among the independent variables. Perfect multicollinearity occurs when one or more independent variables can be perfectly predicted from a linear combination of the other independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Overfitting**: While not an assumption in the traditional sense, ridge regression aims to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the objective function. This penalty term, controlled by the regularization parameter (lambda or alpha), helps stabilize the estimates of the regression coefficients and reduce their variance."

   "source": [
    "1. **Cross-Validation**:\n",
    "   - Cross-validation, particularly k-fold cross-validation, is one of the most common techniques for selecting the tuning parameter in ridge regression.\n",
    "   - In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k subsets (folds). The model is trained on k-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the validation set exactly once.\n",
    "   - The average performance (e.g., mean squared error or another appropriate metric) across all k iterations is calculated for each candidate value of the tuning parameter. The value of lambda that minimizes the average performance metric is selected as the optimal tuning parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Grid Search**:\n",
    "   - Grid search involves specifying a grid of candidate values for the tuning parameter and evaluating the model's performance for each value in the grid.\n",
    "   - This approach systematically evaluates the model's performance for various values of lambda and selects the value that results in the best performance according to a chosen evaluation metric (e.g., mean squared error, cross-validated error).\n",
    "   - Grid search can be computationally intensive, especially for large grids or datasets, but it ensures a thorough exploration of the parameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Randomized Search**:\n",
    "   - Randomized search is similar to grid search but involves sampling candidate values for the tuning parameter randomly from a specified distribution (e.g., uniform distribution).\n",
    "   - This approach can be more efficient than grid search, especially for high-dimensional parameter spaces, as it does not require evaluating all possible combinations of parameter values.\n",
    "   - Randomized search provides a trade-off between computational efficiency and parameter space exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analytical Solutions**:\n",
    "   - In some cases, there may be analytical solutions or closed-form expressions for selecting the optimal tuning parameter in ridge regression, particularly when the data or model assumptions satisfy certain conditions.\n",
    "   - These analytical solutions may involve methods such as generalized cross-validation (GCV), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), or Akaike information criterion (AIC), which provide estimates of the optimal tuning parameter based on model fit and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Domain Knowledge and Prior Information**:\n",
    "   - Domain knowledge and prior information about the data or problem at hand can also inform the selection of the tuning parameter in ridge regression.\n",
    "   - For example, if certain predictors are known to be more or less important based on domain expertise, this information can guide the choice of the regularization parameter."

   "source": [
    "Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection, although it might not better then other techniques like Lasso Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coefficient Magnitudes**: Ridge Regression shrinks the coefficients of predictors towards zero by adding a penalty term to the objective function. Predictors with smaller coefficients after regularization are considered less important in explaining the variance of the target variable. Therefore, you can identify less important predictors by examining their coefficients in the ridge regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relative Importance**: Even though Ridge Regression does not set coefficients exactly to zero, it still prioritizes the shrinkage of less important predictors. By comparing the magnitudes of coefficients across predictors, you can identify relatively less important predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regularization Parameter Tuning**: The choice of the regularization parameter (lambda or alpha) in Ridge Regression can also influence feature selection. Higher values of the regularization parameter increase the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients, potentially driving more coefficients towards zero and effectively performing more aggressive feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Subset Selection**: While Ridge Regression does not perform subset selection explicitly, you can use cross-validation or other techniques to iteratively fit ridge regression models with different subsets of predictors. By selecting the subset of predictors that results in the best model performance (e.g., based on cross-validated error), you can indirectly perform feature selection with Ridge Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Combined with Other Methods**: Ridge Regression can be combined with other feature selection methods to enhance feature selection capabilities. For example, you can use Ridge Regression as a preprocessing step to reduce the dimensionality of the data before applying more aggressive feature selection methods like Lasso Regression."

    "   - Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the objective function, which penalizes large coefficients. This penalty term encourages the model to shrink the coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "   - In the presence of multicollinearity, where predictor variables are highly correlated, the OLS estimates of the regression coefficients may have large variances or be highly sensitive to small changes in the data.\n",

    "   - By introducing a bias to the estimates through the regularization penalty, Ridge Regression achieves a trade-off between bias and variance.\n",
    "   - In the presence of multicollinearity, where the OLS estimates may have high variance, Ridge Regression introduces bias to the estimates in exchange for reduced variance.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Effective Use of Correlated Predictors**:\n",
    "   - Ridge Regression can effectively handle situations where predictor variables are correlated by assigning more balanced weights to correlated predictors.\n",
