    "1. **Euclidean Distance**:\n",
    "   - Definition: Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. It is computed as the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding coordinates.\n",
    "   - Characteristics:\n",
    "     - Considers both the magnitude and direction of differences between coordinates.\n",
    "     - Represents the shortest path between two points.\n",
    "     - Sensitive to the scale of features, as it squares differences, giving more weight to larger differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manhattan Distance**:\n",
    "   - Definition: Manhattan distance, also known as taxicab or city block distance, measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences between their coordinates.\n",
    "   - Characteristics:\n",
    "     - Considers only the magnitude of differences between coordinates, ignoring direction.\n",
    "     - Represents the distance traveled along the grid lines (like navigating city blocks).\n",
    "     - Less sensitive to the scale of features compared to Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect on KNN Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scale Sensitivity**:\n",
    "   - Euclidean distance is more sensitive to the scale of features compared to Manhattan distance. If features are on different scales, Euclidean distance may give more weight to features with larger scales, potentially leading to biased results. In contrast, Manhattan distance is less affected by differences in feature scales.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Dimensionality**:\n",
    "   - In high-dimensional spaces, Euclidean distance tends to become less effective due to the curse of dimensionality, where points become increasingly distant from each other. On the other hand, Manhattan distance may be more robust in high-dimensional spaces because it calculates distance along individual dimensions, rather than considering the overall space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outliers**:\n",
    "   - Manhattan distance can be more robust to outliers compared to Euclidean distance. Since Manhattan distance calculates the distance traveled along grid lines, outliers have less influence on the overall distance calculation compared to Euclidean distance, which considers the straight-line distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpretability**:\n",
    "   - Euclidean distance represents the shortest path between two points, considering both magnitude and direction of differences. This may be more intuitive in some cases. In contrast, Manhattan distance represents the distance traveled along grid lines, ignoring direction, which may be more interpretable in certain scenarios, such as navigating city blocks."
