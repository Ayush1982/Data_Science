    "   Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that deals with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's neural networks. Deep learning algorithms attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple layers of processing units (or neurons) arranged in hierarchical layers. These algorithms have shown remarkable success in tasks such as image and speech recognition."
