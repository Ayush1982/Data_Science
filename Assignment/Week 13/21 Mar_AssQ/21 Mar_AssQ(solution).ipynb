    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical variables into numerical format, but they differ in their application and the type of categorical variables they are suitable for.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
    "   - Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical variable has an inherent order or hierarchy.\n",
    "   - It assigns integer values to categories based on their order, preserving the ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
    "   - The assigned integer values represent the ranking or order of categories, typically starting from 0 or 1.\n",
    "   - Ordinal encoding is suitable for ordinal categorical variables where the categories have a meaningful order but no specific numerical representation.\n",
    "   - Example: Education level (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD) can be encoded as (0, 1, 2, 3) using ordinal encoding to represent the increasing level of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Label Encoding:**\n",
    "   - Label encoding is used when the categorical variable does not have an inherent order or hierarchy.\n",
    "   - It assigns unique integer values to each category without considering any order or ranking.\n",
    "   - The assigned integer values are arbitrary and do not convey any ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
    "   - Label encoding is suitable for nominal categorical variables where categories are unordered and have no meaningful numerical representation.\n",
    "   - Example: Gender (Male, Female) can be encoded as (0, 1) using label encoding, where the integer values are assigned arbitrarily without implying any order or ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset with a categorical variable \"Star Rating\" representing the quality rating of products on an e-commerce platform. The \"Star Rating\" variable has categories ranging from 1 to 5 stars, indicating the quality level of products, where a higher number of stars corresponds to higher quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we want to preserve the ordinal relationship between the star ratings (e.g., 1 star < 2 stars < 3 stars < ... < 5 stars), we would choose ordinal encoding. This ensures that the encoded numerical values reflect the ordinal ranking of star ratings.\n",
    "- However, if the order of star ratings is not meaningful in our analysis (e.g., the star ratings are treated as nominal categories with no specific order), we would choose label encoding. This assigns unique numerical values to each star rating category without implying any order or ranking.\n"

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable in a supervised learning problem. It assigns ordinal numerical values to categories of a categorical variable, considering the relationship between the categories and the target variable. This encoding method aims to capture the ordinal relationship between the categories while maximizing the predictive power of the encoded variable with respect to the target variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Order the Categories Based on the Mean or Median of the Target Variable:**\n",
    "   - Order the categories of the categorical variable based on the calculated mean or median of the target variable in ascending or descending order. This creates an ordinal relationship between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assign Ordinal Numerical Values to Categories:**\n",
    "   - Assign ordinal numerical values to the categories based on their order. Categories associated with lower mean or median values of the target variable are assigned lower ordinal values, while categories associated with higher mean or median values are assigned higher ordinal values.\n",

    "Covariance is a measure of the degree to which two variables change together. It quantifies the relationship between two variables, indicating whether they tend to increase or decrease together (positive covariance), move in opposite directions (negative covariance), or have no consistent pattern of movement (zero covariance).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measuring Relationship:** Covariance helps to understand the relationship between two variables. A positive covariance indicates a direct relationship (variables increase/decrease together), while a negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship (one variable increases while the other decreases).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assessing Variability:** Covariance provides information about the variability of variables. Higher covariance values indicate greater variability, suggesting that the variables are more likely to deviate from their means.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Linear Dependence:** Covariance is a measure of linear dependence between variables. It assesses how well the variables can be predicted from each other using a linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multivariate Analysis:** Covariance is used in multivariate analysis to understand the joint variability of multiple variables and their interrelationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "cov(X, Y) = 1/n sumesion_of_(X_i - bar{X}) * (Y_i - bar{Y})\n",

    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, covariance is the average of the products of the deviations of each variable from its mean. If the covariance value is positive, it indicates a positive relationship between variables; if it is negative, it indicates a negative relationship; and if it is close to zero, it indicates little to no linear relationship between variables."
